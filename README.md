# Tactical Parking
HTML5 canvas game using the Crafty engine and RequireJS for modular script loading.

     Work-in-progress! Feel free to use this as a template if you'd like to use RequireJS for your own Crafty game.

## Premise
Guide your vehicle into a parking spot near a like-colored vehicle in the parking lot before colliding with an NPV 
(non-playable vehicle). Doing this removes both cars to free up space for your next vehicle to park.
